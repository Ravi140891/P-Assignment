              The
              <span style="color: #0645ad"><b>Second Punic War</b></span>
              (218–201 BC) was the second of
              <span style="color: #0645ad">three wars</span> fought between
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Carthage</span> and
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Rome</span>, the two main powers of
              the western <span style="color: #0645ad">Mediterranean</span> in
              the 3rd century BC. For 17 years the two states struggled for
              supremacy. After immense
              <span style="color: #0645ad">materiel</span> and human losses on
              both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Macedonia</span>,
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Syracuse</span> and several
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Numidian</span> kingdoms were drawn
              into the fighting, and
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Iberian</span> and
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Gallic</span> forces fought on both
              sides. There were three main
              <span style="color: #0645ad">military theatres</span> during the
              war: Italy, where
              <span style="color: #0645ad">Hannibal</span> defeated the Roman
              legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary campaigns on the
              islands of <span style="color: #0645ad">Sicily</span> and
              <span>Sardinia</span> and in Greece; Iberia, where
              <span>Hasdrubal</span>, a younger brother of Hannibal, defended
              the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success before moving
              into Italy; and North Africa, where Rome finally won the war. A
              peace treaty stripped the Carthaginians of all overseas
              territories, and prohibited them from waging war outside Africa.

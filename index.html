                        the 3rd century BC. For 17 years the two states struggled for
                        supremacy. After immense
                        <span style="color: #0645ad">materiel</span> and human losses on

                        <span style="color: #0645ad">military theatres</span> during the
                        war: Italy, where

                        legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary campaigns on the
                        islands of <span style="color: #0645ad">Sicily</span> and
                        <span>Sardinia</span> and in Greece; Iberia, where
                        <span>Hasdrubal</span>, a younger brother of Hannibal, defended
                        the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success before moving
                        into Italy; and North Africa, where Rome finally won the war. A
                        peace treaty stripped the Carthaginians of all overseas
                        territories, and prohibited them from waging war outside Africa.
